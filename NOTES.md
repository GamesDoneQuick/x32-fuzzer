# Things we need to write the basic fuzzer

-   need list of possible commands/packets to send
-   need a loop that can run at some specified speed, picking commands at random to send to the mixer
-   need a heartbeatsystem to identify when the mixer has stopped responding so we know when it crashes
-   need to log everything
